		<h2 style="color:black;"> <em> My Hobbies and Interests</em> </h2>
		<br>
		<h4 style="color:black;"> <p> One of my hobbies is to play volleyball because, I'm not that into sports. I love watching movies, it gives me the relaxing feeling that I always want to feel.
                         Im a 2nd year student here at Asia Pacific College(APC) and Im taking up Information Technology. It was really hard from the day it was started because, 
Im just into computers but I don't know how to manipulate a computer. It always interest me when the lesson is related to my course so, I can learn new things and apply it in the future. Someday, I will travel the world with my mom.</p> </h4>
